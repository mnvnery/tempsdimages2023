Although his work seems to focus on the future, he is, in reality, dealing with the present, specifically on how experience and expectations materialise into decisions and the nuances of the interaction between "us" and "our context". Alvarenga is guest assistant professor in Strategic Foresight and Scenario Planning at Nova School of Business and Economics (NOVA SBE), Carcavelos, and founding member of ALVA Research&Consulting. He has collaborated, over a number of years, with more than one hundred national and international organizations.

He was rapporteur to the Ministry of Environment, Spatial Planning and Energy on the Agenda for Sustainable Development. Director of the Department of Innovation and Strategic Sectors of the Municipality of Lisbon - Directorate of Economics and Innovation, and Head of Division of Policy Planning and Strategic Foresight. 

In the last few years, Alvarenga has created, co-created and directed a number of performative works, most of them collaborative projects with choreographers, dramaturgs, theatre, and film directors and other artists, such as João Fiadeiro, Leonor Barata, Maria João Guardão/João Nunes, Marta Wengorovius, Miguel Castro Caldas, Sofia Moura/Dennis Xavier and Sónia Barbosa. 

He is presently working on the performance Conselhos para colocar as coisas no seu devido lugar errado, having written, up to this date, 426 aphorisms-advice (conselhos) which constitute the basis for an ongoing series of talks, performances, and collaborations with other artists.

                    <div class="w-lg-50 font-archer px-lg-5 px-4 pt-lg-0 pt-3">There is a point in our human lives when we clearly feel that the ground is slowly pulling us down. So, we look up, hands raised like a flower devouring the sky, begging to gravity for a truce. 
For some, this is how they find God, for others this is how they discover birds. In this performance we lean over from the sky, so that we can, before it is too late, learn something from those patronising know-it-alls.</div>

Loneliness does not favor us.

The name comes from a mythical interview with José Mourinho in 2018, in which he quotes the philosopher Hegel, "The Truth is in the Whole", which, in his broken English, sounded like "the trout is in the hole" (Truta no Buraco). 

It is precisely on the reflection of the whole that our work intends to focus, constructing a historical perspective from its shadow.

We embrace the conviction that this group is genuinely committed to producing critical thinking about the world through a more accessible and less politically based culture. And so, quixotically, we have been trying to navigate our way through the intricacies of the arts to which (for our sins) we have decided to devote ourselves.

In this time of Ubus we don’t want to let our blood, while we can still ignite it, go to waste. We will pour it onto the stage.  That’s all.

The Truta no Buraco gang are:  Andreia Farinha and João Melo (founding members), José Smith Vargas, Manuel Bivar, and more recently Raphael Soares, Anafaia Supico, João Ayton, Ricardo Donas, and Francisca Bagulho.</div>

WILD FLOWERS is a pop-experimental project based on William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, which proposes a deconstruction of the classic text, a fusion of theatre with video, and an exploration of the ‘space-character’ Hamlet. Although anchored in the original text, it is a rewriting of the classic, based on exploring the body as a vocabulary of action, transcending the limits of spoken language and gender identity.

He participated in the XIX edition of Nova École des Maîtres. Neto debuted as an actor in 1999, in O Achamento, a play directed by Madalena Wallenstein. He worked with several theatre directors, among them: João Garcia Miguel, Joaquim Benite, Carlos J. Pessoa, Carlos Gomes, Celso Cleto, Matthew Lenton, Álvaro Correia, Maria João Luís, João Mota and João Lourenço. He was an actor in the film Mistérios de Lisboa, by Raul Ruiz, and in the short O Nome e o N.I.M., by Inês Oliveira. He has acted in telenovelas and series for various national channels. In parallel to his work as an actor, he has been involved in theatre projects, such as: Luto, Worms and Mechanical Monsters (both funded by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, in 2013 and 2015 respectively) and Catch My Soul, for Teatro de Carnide. Neto directed Huis Clos (No Exit), by Jean-Paul Sartre, for the Teatro de Carnide, and A Cabeça Muda, a play by Cláudia Lucas Chéu (a LAMA production funded by GDA and by the Algarve Regional Directorate for Culture). In 2015 he staged, for the theatre company Escola de Mulheres, Breviário para um Extermínio Silencioso, adapted from Mike Bartlett’s play Contractions. He founded LoboMau Produções in 2016, which produced the performance Trocava a minha fama por uma caneca de cerveja, a cocreation with Teresa Sobral for the Festival Glorioso Verão at Teatro Municipal São Luiz. This was followed by the staging of Huis Clos(No Exit), by Jean-Paul Sartre. He wrote and directed Neptuno, a commission from CAPA/DeVIR, for the Festival Encontros do DeVIR 2017. Still in 2017 he writes and directs Välute, a play that toured in 2018 with funding from DGArtes. In 2019 he directed O Crocodilo ou o Extraórdinario Acontecimento Irrelevante at the Teatro Municipal São Luiz and 3GODS at the Teatro Trindade. 

Neto also directed audiovisual projects, namely, Bernardo’s World Domination, a commission by RTP to commemorate the centenary of the birth of Bernardo Santareno. He codirected, with Jorge Albuquerque, the feature film Titus. He is presently working in projects at Teatro Aberto.</div>

He next directed Boa Alma (2015), Palácio de Cristal (2016), and Caos Danado (2018). Proskénion, his new documentary, is in line of his other documentaries addressing the performing arts. Presently, he is working on two new documentaries: Este não é o teu corpo, in which he follows the trajectory of the dancer and dramaturg Diana Niepce, and another that explores the theme of vocal direction, accompanying a group of performers in theatrical productions, largely based on the work of João Henriques. He also directed the web-series Os Muralistas (produced by After Wall & Dyrup). Besides his work in film, he has acted in several projects, both in the theatre and in cinema.</div>
