synopsis: >-
  This fish is a sea bass. In fact "sea bass" is the common name for a genus of
  the Percidae family, the labrax perch, much appreciated for its meat.
  Delicious meat. 

  The longer it takes for a sea bass to bite, the more delicious it tastes. 

  We eat so many things. We know so little about them.

      (b. 1974) works in strategic foresight and scenario planning, with strong
      and sometimes unexpected intersections with other fields, especially the
      performing arts. Although his work seems to focus on the future, he is, in
      reality, dealing with the present, specifically on how experience and
      expectations materialise into decisions and the nuances of the interaction
      between "us" and "our context". Alvarenga is guest assistant professor in
      Strategic Foresight and Scenario Planning at Nova School of Business and
      Economics (NOVA SBE), Carcavelos, and founding member of ALVA
      Research&Consulting. He has collaborated, over a number of years, with
      more than one hundred national and international organizations. He is
      researcher at the Centre for Management Studies (CEG-IST) at Instituto
      Superior Técnico (IST), Lisbon, as well as associate researcher at the
      Institute of Contemporary History (HIS), at the School of Social Sciences
      and Humanities (FCSH), Lisbon. He contributed articles to several
      specialized publications at both national and international levels.
      Alvarenga holds a PhD in Management Science (Lyon 3), a Bachelor’s degree
      in Economy (FEP - School of Economics and Management, University of
      Porto), an MSc in European Economics Studies (College of Europe, Bruges),
      and a Postgraduate Diploma in Strategic Studies (ISCSP - Institute of
      Social and Political Sciences (University of Lisbon).


      Alvarenga directed the Department of strategies and economic analysis of the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA). He was rapporteur to the Ministry of Environment, Spatial Planning and Energy on the Agenda for Sustainable Development. Director of the Department of Innovation and Strategic Sectors of the Municipality of Lisbon - Directorate of Economics and Innovation, and Head of Division of Policy Planning and Strategic Foresight. 


      In the last few years, Alvarenga has created, co-created and directed a number of performative works, most of them collaborative projects with choreographers, dramaturgs, theatre, and film directors and other artists, such as João Fiadeiro, Leonor Barata, Maria João Guardão/João Nunes, Marta Wengorovius, Miguel Castro Caldas, Sofia Moura/Dennis Xavier and Sónia Barbosa. 


      He is presently working on the performance Conselhos para colocar as coisas no seu devido lugar errado, having written, up to this date, 426 aphorisms-advice (conselhos) which constitute the basis for an ongoing series of talks, performances, and collaborations with other artists.
