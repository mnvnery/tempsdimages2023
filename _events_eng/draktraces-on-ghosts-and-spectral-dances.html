synopsis: A dance in the disappearance of its own trail. Without a sense of
  belonging. The past manifests itself in bodies that have given way to their
  multiple existences, ghosts of themselves - either already extinct or still
  waiting to be. Bodies belong to both matter and memory, imagination and
  perceived reality, the visible and the hidden, sharing an existential
  loneliness between life and death.

  - artist_bio: Joana Castro
    bio: Joana Castro (Porto, 1988) is a non-binary lesbian artist. She develops her
      projects in the fields of dance, performance and sound. Some of her works
      have been presented in Portugal, France, Belgium, Germany and Brazil.
      Besides issues like death, grief, and end-of-life rituals that impact her
      personal life and invade her creations, gender issues are pervasive
      throughout her trajectory in a search for a body that (de)constructs its
      image and operates in BETWEEN states – at the threshold of human borders,
      without gender."
