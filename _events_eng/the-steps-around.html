synopsis: The Steps Around is a performative journey in the Alcântara area that
  explores a choreographic interpretation of walking, proposing poetic and
  performative interventions that reconfigure our relationship with the city's
  times and how we experience it. Crossing familiar paths, neglected spaces in
  urban history, and hidden places, we propose a dive into this part of the
  city, where temporal strata, interrupted trajectories, and proliferating paths
  overlap, reconfiguring the way we perceive it.

      spatial, discursive, sound, visual and performative practices to explore
      the aesthetic experience of space, as well as its cultural, political and
      social dimensions. The artist focuses on walking as an experimental and
      artistic practice to critically rethink the inhabited space and the
      relationship we establish with it. Her professional activity has been
      multifaceted, comprising research, curatorship, writing and artistic
      practice.
