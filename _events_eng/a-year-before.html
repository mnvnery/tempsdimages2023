  In A Year Before we celebrate loss in a performance-fair. A master of
  ceremonies guides the audience on a tragi-comic journey through the intimate
  universe of a motherless daughter. What is it that remains besides the words
  she left in written records of her daily life? How do you go from one
  fracturing situation to another one, of reconstruction?

  Trailer or prologue, 1 ANO ANTES continues. As life does.
