synopsis: >
  “Locked in his room since the death of his father, Hamlet plays PlayStation…”
  This is the opening line of this tragedy.

  WILD FLOWERS is a pop-experimental project based on William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, which proposes a deconstruction of the classic text, a fusion of theatre with video, and an exploration of the ‘space-character’ Hamlet. Although anchored in the original text, it is a rewriting of the classic, based on exploring the body as a vocabulary of action, transcending the limits of spoken language and gender identity.
