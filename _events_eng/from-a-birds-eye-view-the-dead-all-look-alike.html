synopsis: >-
  There is a point in our human lives when we clearly feel that the ground is
  slowly pulling us down. So, we look up, hands raised like a flower devouring
  the sky, begging to gravity for a truce. 

  For some, this is how they find God, for others this is how they discover birds. In this performance we lean over from the sky, so that we can, before it is too late, learn something from those patronising know-it-alls.

    bio: >-
      Truta no Buraco is a company formed by a bunch of people who, as an
      artistic team, have been consolidating a style while reflecting about
      social and cultural issues, trying to gain insight into what is expected
      from our work. Loneliness does not favor us.


      The name comes from a mythical interview with José Mourinho in 2018, in which he quotes the philosopher Hegel, "The Truth is in the Whole", which, in his broken English, sounded like "the trout is in the hole" (Truta no Buraco). 


      It is precisely on the reflection of the whole that our work intends to focus, constructing a historical perspective from its shadow.


      We embrace the conviction that this group is genuinely committed to producing critical thinking about the world through a more accessible and less politically based culture. And so, quixotically, we have been trying to navigate our way through the intricacies of the arts to which (for our sins) we have decided to devote ourselves.


      In this time of Ubus we don’t want to let our blood, while we can still ignite it, go to waste. We will pour it onto the stage.  That’s all.


      The Truta no Buraco gang are:  Andreia Farinha and João Melo (founding members), José Smith Vargas, Manuel Bivar, and more recently Raphael Soares, Anafaia Supico, João Ayton, Ricardo Donas, and Francisca Bagulho.
