synopsis: >-
  In a globalized world in constant transformation, Fernando spends his time
  designing other places. He shares his daily life with directors, interpreters,
  choreographers, carpenters. He creates set designs for performances while he
  renovates his studio.  His imaginary brings us closer to this art that
  (de)codifies words and translates the indescribable.

  But besides Fernando’s, another voice is heard that infringes on everyday life.

    bio: "Eduardo Breda completed the Interpretation Course from the Academia
      Contemporânea do Espectáculo (Porto) in 2008. He has a BA in Theatre –
      Acting from the Lisbon Film and Theatre School (ESTC) (2012). In 2014 he
      was the recipient of a scholarship from Centro Nacional de Cultura to
      direct and produce his first documentary, O Retrato. He next directed Boa
      Alma (2015), Palácio de Cristal (2016), and Caos Danado (2018).
      Proskénion, his new documentary, is in line of his other documentaries
      addressing the performing arts. Presently, he is working on two new
      documentaries: Este não é o teu corpo, in which he follows the trajectory
      of the dancer and dramaturg Diana Niepce, and another that explores the
      theme of vocal direction, accompanying a group of performers in theatrical
      productions, largely based on the work of João Henriques. He also directed
      the web-series Os Muralistas (produced by After Wall & Dyrup). Besides his
      work in film, he has acted in several projects, both in the theatre and in
      cinema."
