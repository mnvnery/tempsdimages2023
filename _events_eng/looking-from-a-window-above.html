    bio: >-
      Jessica Guez is a transdisciplinary artist and performer.


      She dances with paintings (which she sometimes paints herself) and creates artistic works with her body and her imagination. She uses video, dance, painting, and music as tools to represent a certain naivety and fragility. She is interested in collaborating with artists from different fields, like Ruy Otero, Lina Schlageter or Miguel Pereira. Guez made a documentary about DJ Nuno Bernardino and has presented exhibitions in domestic spaces.
